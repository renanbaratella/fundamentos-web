    <p>Fictional history
        Legolas was the son of Thranduil, King of the Woodland Realm of Northern Mirkwood,[T 1] who appeared as "the
        Elvenking" in The Hobbit.[T 2] Thranduil, one of the Sindar or "Grey Elves",[T 3] ruled over the Silvan Elves or
        "Wood-elves" of Mirkwood.[T 1]

        Legolas is introduced at the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, where he came as a messenger from his father to
        discuss Gollum's escape from their guard.[T 1] Legolas was chosen to be a member of the Fellowship of the Ring,
        charged with destroying the One Ring. He accompanied the other members in their travels from Rivendell to Amon
        Hen, serving as the company's archer.[T 4] When the fellowship was trapped by a snowstorm while crossing the
        Misty Mountains, Legolas scouted ahead, running lightly over the snow, and told Aragorn and Boromir that the
        thick snow they were trying to push through was only a narrow wall.[T 4] Back in the lowlands of Hollin, Legolas
        helped fend off an attack by Saruman's wargs. Gandalf then led the fellowship on a journey underground through
        Moria.[T 5] In Moria, Legolas helped fight off Orcs and recognized "Durin's Bane" as a Balrog.[T 6] After
        Gandalf's fall, Aragorn led the Fellowship to the Elven realm of Lothlórien. Legolas spoke to the Elf-sentries
        there on behalf of the Fellowship.[T 7]

        There was initially friction between Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli, because of the ancient quarrel between Elves
        and Dwarves, rekindled by Thranduil's treatment of Gimli's father Glóin.[T 2] Legolas and Gimli became friends
        when Gimli greeted Galadriel respectfully.[T 7] When the fellowship left Lothlórien, Galadriel gave the members
        gifts; Legolas received a longbow,[T 8] which he used to bring down a Nazgûl's flying steed in the dark with one
        shot.[T 9]

        After Boromir's death and the capture of Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took by orcs, Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli
        set out across Rohan in pursuit of the two captured hobbits.[T 10] In the forest of Fangorn Legolas and his
        companions met Gandalf, resurrected as "Gandalf the White," who delivered a message to Legolas from Galadriel.
        Legolas interpreted this as foretelling the end of his stay in Middle-earth:</p>
