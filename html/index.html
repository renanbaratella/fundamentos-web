        <p>Daryl Dixon is a fictional character from AMC's horror drama series The Walking Dead. The character was created for the television series by writers Frank Darabont, Charles H. Eglee and Jack LoGiudice specifically for Norman Reedus, and does not have a counterpart in the comics on which the series is based. The character was introduced in the first season as a southerner, expert tracker, living in the shadow of his older brother, Merle. Despite his bad temper and volatility, he is tolerated by the core group of survivors due to his skills in hunting animals and fearless efficiency in killing walkers.

            After Merle's disappearance, Daryl lets his guard down and starts to bond with the group, particularly Carol Peletier after her daughter's disappearance, and Beth Greene after the two split off together in season 4. The character becomes the cooperative right-hand man and protector of protagonist Rick Grimes and leads several supply runs. He is one of the longest surviving characters of the television series. His origin is explored in the 2013 video game The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct, and he stars in the mobile game The Walking Dead: No Man's Land.
            
            Daryl has been well–received by fans and critics. Initially a member of the recurring cast, Reedus was upgraded to series regular after the first season. Following Andrew Lincoln's departure as Rick, Reedus got top billing and took over as the series' main protagonist in season 9.
            
            In September 2020, it was announced that Reedus and Melissa McBride will lead their own spin-off series set for a 2023 premiere, following the conclusion of The Walking Dead's eleventh and final season.[1]

        <p>Fictional history
            Legolas was the son of Thranduil, King of the Woodland Realm of Northern Mirkwood,[T 1] who appeared as "the Elvenking" in The Hobbit.[T 2] Thranduil, one of the Sindar or "Grey Elves",[T 3] ruled over the Silvan Elves or "Wood-elves" of Mirkwood.[T 1]
            
            Legolas is introduced at the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, where he came as a messenger from his father to discuss Gollum's escape from their guard.[T 1] Legolas was chosen to be a member of the Fellowship of the Ring, charged with destroying the One Ring. He accompanied the other members in their travels from Rivendell to Amon Hen, serving as the company's archer.[T 4] When the fellowship was trapped by a snowstorm while crossing the Misty Mountains, Legolas scouted ahead, running lightly over the snow, and told Aragorn and Boromir that the thick snow they were trying to push through was only a narrow wall.[T 4] Back in the lowlands of Hollin, Legolas helped fend off an attack by Saruman's wargs. Gandalf then led the fellowship on a journey underground through Moria.[T 5] In Moria, Legolas helped fight off Orcs and recognized "Durin's Bane" as a Balrog.[T 6] After Gandalf's fall, Aragorn led the Fellowship to the Elven realm of Lothlórien. Legolas spoke to the Elf-sentries there on behalf of the Fellowship.[T 7]
            
            There was initially friction between Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli, because of the ancient quarrel between Elves and Dwarves, rekindled by Thranduil's treatment of Gimli's father Glóin.[T 2] Legolas and Gimli became friends when Gimli greeted Galadriel respectfully.[T 7] When the fellowship left Lothlórien, Galadriel gave the members gifts; Legolas received a longbow,[T 8] which he used to bring down a Nazgûl's flying steed in the dark with one shot.[T 9]
            
            After Boromir's death and the capture of Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took by orcs, Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli set out across Rohan in pursuit of the two captured hobbits.[T 10] In the forest of Fangorn Legolas and his companions met Gandalf, resurrected as "Gandalf the White," who delivered a message to Legolas from Galadriel. Legolas interpreted this as foretelling the end of his stay in Middle-earth:</p>
